					Of course you wanna start and you wanna work on the code,
					you just learned! That's ok for sure, the worst you can do
					is just to much think about. But in the retrospective of my
					homepage there are some things considering them first will
					save you a lot of time.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="textBlog">imagine your page first</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="textBlog">
					What I mean by that is, that you should think about the
					design of your page first, then build it. The design you see
					right now is probably the fourth version of how the page
					looked in the beginning. By the way, if you want to see the
					evolution of this page you can check out my GitHub
					repository right
					<a
						href="https://github.com/Joslef/joergOnline"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						class="link"
						>here</a
					>. There are several tools that can help you to imagine your
					result first.
					<a
						href="https://www.figma.com/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						class="link"
						>Figma</a
					>,
					<a
						href="https://www.sketch.com/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						class="link"
						>Sketch</a
					>
					or
					<a
						href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						class="link"
						>Adobe XD</a
					>
					just to name a few. Use these tools, u can simulate the
					behavoir of a webpage pretty well. With the right design of
					your page, this brings me to bulletpoint number 2:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="textBlog">
						which colors and fonts you want to use?
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="textBlog">
					With the right design of your page there is no more question
					about fonts and colors. This is a thing I really
					underestimated. In the process of this page I had 6
					different fonts and colors each. Thats way to much, also you
					got to keep in mind that a good design is as important as
					function. Finally:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="textBlog">
						use as few as possible classes and ids in your css file
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="textBlog">
					This is probably the most difficult part as a beginner. I
					can imagine everyone evolves his own ideas of styling a
					page. But to decide first, what will be a tag, what is class
					and why not use an id? Furthermore you will do way too much
					classes and ids in the beginning. This makes it easy right
					from the start, but you really have to pay later! Defining
					its own class for every possible situation will blow your
					css file up. Of course you don't know what belongs to what
					later. Also the first bullet point in this blog entry will
					help you to keep your css file clean and simple. In my case
					I got two css files for darkmode also, so believe me!
