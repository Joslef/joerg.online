					As I mentioned on my homepage (by the way, a lot of people
					always mix the two terms 'homepage' and 'webpage') before,
					it is really not easy to start to code. Why is this so? I
					would say there are two main reasons that reinforce this
					fact.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p class="textBlog">
					<strong>#1: education is way behind industry</strong>
				</p>
				<br />
				<p class="textBlog">
					I remember the first contact with computers at my school.
					The equipment was already oldschool back in the 90ies! But
					this was just hardware. You can 'update' your equipment by
					spending money (ok, that's easier said than done in the
					public sector!). But the real problem is knowledge. You have
					to keep up with the industry regarding standards and
					technology. This fact getting worse because as a teacher you
					have to be on top to tell the people what to learn. That's
					no easy job in the educational sector. In the private sector
					you got your boss, who tells you to implement the new
					technology by end of the week 👨‍💼☝️. But I really don't want
					to badmouth the educational sector, quite the opposite!
					...much love to the
					<a

						>University of Regensburg</a
					>
					by the way ❤️! I really enjoyed the time at the university
					and of course this educational system is absolut necessary
					for the future of a coutry and its people...This brings me
					to thesis

				<br />
				<p class="textBlog">
					<strong>#2: this industry is HUUUUUUGE 👱‍</strong>
				</p>
				<br />
				<p class="textBlog">
					You don't need bad hair to understand this. Starting with
					the language itself, the different libraries, frameworks,
					tools,...The 'problem' is that this industry is HUUU...ok
					enough... by itself, it also has a very rapid devolpment
					rate, espacially all things related javascript, in my
					opinion. No proof, but a note towards the rigth direction:
					just check the
					<a
						href="https://octoverse.github.com/projects.html"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						class="link"
						>github octoverse</a
					>, js is way ahead (...as is 👍)! A lot of repos on github
					is no proof, right, but it may be a good correlation between
					'activity' and development in one language. Thank god the
					internet has a lot of information about this also! One
					article I already mentioned in my blog, but I have to
					mention it again, because it can help you a lot is

					This can be the start for every new coder! Find your way and
					you got your language. Maybe it's not that simple. I was a
					little surprised how few lines ended in javascript! But at
					least it's the powerful underestimated (we are still in
					LOR...)
