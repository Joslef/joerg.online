					As I mentioned on my homepage (by the way, a lot of people
					always mix the two terms 'homepage' and 'webpage') before,
					it is really not easy to start to code. Why is this so? I
					would say there are two main reasons that reinforce this
					fact.
				</p>
				<br /><br /><br />
				<p class="textBlog">
					<strong>#1: education is way behind industry</strong>
				</p>
				<br /><br />
				<p class="textBlog">
					I remember the first contact with computers at my school.
					The equipment was already oldschool back in the 90ies! But
					this was just hardware. You can 'update' your equipment by
					spending money (ok, that's easier said than done in the
					public sector!). But the real problem is knowledge. You have
					to keep up with the industry regarding standards and
					technology. This fact getting worse because as a teacher you
					have to be on top to tell the people what to learn. That's
					no easy job in the educational sector. In the private sector
					you got your boss, who tells you to implement the new
					technology by end of the week üë®‚Äçüíº‚òùÔ∏è. But I really don't want
					to badmouth the educational sector, quite the opposite!
					...much love to the
					<a
						href="https://www.uni-regensburg.de/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						class="link"
						>University of Regensburg</a
					>
					by the way ‚ù§Ô∏è! I really enjoyed the time at the university
					and of course this educational system is absolut necessary
					for the future of a coutry and its people...This brings me
					to thesis
				</p>
				<br /><br /><br />
				<p class="textBlog">
					<strong>#2: this industry is HUUUUUUGE üë±‚Äç</strong>
				</p>
				<br /><br />
				<p class="textBlog">
					You don't need bad hair to understand this. Starting with
					the language itself, the different libraries, frameworks,
					tools,...The 'problem' is that this industry is HUUU...ok
					enough... by itself, it also has a very rapid devolpment
					rate, espacially all things related javascript, in my
					opinion. No proof, but a note towards the rigth direction:
					just check the
					<a
						href="https://octoverse.github.com/projects.html"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						class="link"
						>github octoverse</a
					>, js is way ahead (...as is üëç)! A lot of repos on github
					is no proof, right, but it may be a good correlation between
					'activity' and development in one language. Thank god the
					internet has a lot of information about this also! One
					article I already mentioned in my blog, but I have to
					mention it again, because it can help you a lot is

					This can be the start for every new coder! Find your way
					through and you got your language! Maybe it's not that
					simple. I was a little surprised how few lines ended up in
					javascript! But at least it's the powerful underestimated
					(we are still in LotR...). <br />

						The Ultimate 2019 Web Developer Roadmap</a
					>. He splits his roadmap into two parts. First ones are the
					common coding skills, second one is the frontend section of
					web development. For the first part of course you need the
					three absolute basics javascript, html and css. Sandeep
					calls html and css as the 'lifeblood of web development'.
					Later on, for the second part of frontend web development,
					you got several choices which path you want to follow and
					also some recommended/must-have tools. This infographic
					gives you quite a good overview: <br /><br /><br />

					As you can see the blue path are the basics. Later, you can
					choose between several orange branches. As he points out,
					main decision will later be which framework to choose. The
					three most known are React.js Angular and Vue.js. I will do
					another blog post about which framework to choose later.
					Interesting in Sandeep's article are the other tools he
					recommends to learn. Most important in the list (in my
					opinion) is .git and github. Even working alone on a code is
					very convenient because:
					<br /><br />
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="textBlog">backup</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="textBlog">
					a backup of your code, even your complete project. It gets
					even more convenient, if you use a cloud remote git like
					github.
				</p>
				<br />
				<ol start="2">
					<li class="textBlog">versioning</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="textBlog">
					you get versioning in your code, that means you can switch
					between different branches, developing a new feature for
					example, and you can get back to a earlier state of your
					code. (For a short overview I recommend this
					<a
						href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc&list=PL2ygOM0PqdO_pU5u5B3cukJl7o0MSmoPY&index=4&t=1725s"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						class="link"
						>video
					</a>
					from Traversy Media, he gives you a quick lesson about the
					most important git commands).
					<br /><br /><br />
				</p>

				<p class="textBlog">
					But also the other topics in Sandeep's list will give you a
					general basis of web-development. Important of course other
					topics like
					<strong>HTTP/HTTPS</strong>,
					<strong>Data Structures</strong> and
					<strong>Algorithms</strong>.<br />
					My personal choice is javascript, not only because it's easy
					to learn (regarding the LotR overview), but also you got a
					bunch of possibilities to work on later. My next decision
					will be which framework I'm gonna to choose. Until then I
					will do my javascript lessons and wonder what a hobbit üßù‚Äç
					would do...
