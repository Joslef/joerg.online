						As I mentioned on my homepage before, it is really not
						easy to start to code. Why is this so? I would say there
						are two main reasons that reinforce this fact.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<strong
							><li>
								education is way behind industry
							</li></strong
						>
					</ol>
					<p class="card-text mb-3 mt-4 text-justify">
						I remember the first contact with computers at my
						school. The equipment was already oldschool back in the
						90ies! But this was just hardware. You can 'update' your
						equipment by spending money (ok, that's easier said than
						done in the public sector!). But the real problem is
						knowledge. You have to keep up with the industry
						regarding standards and technology. This fact getting
						worse because as a teacher you have to be on top to tell
						the people what to learn. That's no easy job in the
						educational sector. In the private sector you got your
						boss, who tells you to implement the new technology by
						end of the week 👨‍💼☝️. But I really don't want to
						badmouth the educational sector, quite the opposite!
						Much love to the University of Regensburg by the way ❤️!
						I really enjoyed the time at the university and of
						course this educational system is absolut necessary for
						the future of a coutry and its people...This brings me
						to thesis
					</p>
					<ol start="2">
						<strong
							><li>
								this industry is HUUUUUUGE 👱‍
							</li></strong
						>
					</ol>
					<p class="card-text mb-3 mt-4 text-justify">
						You don't need bad hair to understand this. Starting
						with the language itself, the different libraries,
						frameworks, tools,...The 'problem' is that this industry
						is HUUU...ok enough... by itself, it also has a very
						rapid devolpment rate, espacially all things related
						javascript, in my opinion. No proof, but a note towards
						the rigth direction: just check the
						<a href="https://octoverse.github.com/projects.html"
							>github octoverse</a
						>, js is way ahead (...as is 👍)! A lot of repos on
						github is no proof, right, but it may be a good
						correlation between 'activity' and development in one
						language. Thank god the internet has a lot of
						information about this also! But before I started my
						first lessons on
						<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a>
						There is one infographic that I really enjoyed! This
						picture from carlcheo.com gives you a first (and also
						funny) overview to the different programming languages
						and the analogy to Lord of the Rings:
					</p>
					<img
						src="/../joergOnline/blog/190502/programming-language.png"

						><p class="text-right">source: carlcheo.com</p></a
					>
					<p class="card-text mb-3 mt-4 text-justify">
						This can be the start for every new coder! Find your way
						through and you got your language! Maybe it's not that
						simple. I was a little surprised how few lines ended up
						in javascript! But at least it's the powerful
						underestimated (we are still in LotR...). Another good
						overview is from Sandeep Mehta who gives you an update
						of the
						<a
							href="https://codeburst.io/the-ultimate-2019-web-developer-roadmap-7d024cbe973a"
							>The Ultimate 2019 Web Developer Roadmap</a
						>. He splits his roadmap into two parts. First ones are
						the common coding skills, second one is the frontend
						section of web development. For the first part of course
						you need the three absolute basics javascript, html and
						css. Sandeep calls html and css as the 'lifeblood of web
						development'. Later on, for the second part of frontend
						web development, you got several choices which path you
						want to follow and also some recommended/must-have
						tools. This infographic gives you quite a good overview:
					</p>
					<img
						src="/../joergOnline/blog/190502/roadmap.png"
						class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"
						alt="roadmap"
					/>
					<a
						href="https://codeburst.io/the-ultimate-2019-web-developer-roadmap-7d024cbe973a"
						><p class="text-right">source: codeburst.io</p></a
					>
					<p class="card-text mb-3 mt-4 text-justify">
						As you can see the blue path are the basics. Later, you
						can choose between several orange branches. As he points
						out, main decision will later be which framework to
						choose. The three most known are React.js Angular and
						Vue.js. I will do another blog post about which
						framework to choose later. Interesting in Sandeep's
						article are the other tools he recommends to learn. Most
						important in the list (in my opinion) is git and github.
						Even working alone on a code is very convenient because
						you have a backup of your code, even your complete
						project. It gets even more convenient, if you use a
						origin like github. You also get versioning in your
						code, that means you can switch between different
						branches, developing a new feature for example, and you
						can get back to a earlier state of your code. But also
						the other topics in Sandeep's list will give you a
						general basis of web-development. Important of course
						other topics like HTTP/HTTPS, Data Structures and
						Algorithms. My personal choice is javascript, not only
						because it's easy to learn (regarding to the LotR
						overview), but also you got a bunch of possibilities to
						work on later. My next decision will be which framework
						I'm gonna to choose. Until then I will do my javascript
						lessons and wonder what a hobbit 🧝‍ would do...
